# Work-Day-Sceduler
A 9:00 am to 5:00 pm work day planner
How it Works
Make a calendar to represent the workday: 9AM-5PM.
The day is shown in hour time blocks.
Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it occurs in the past (gray), present (red) or future green.
Each time block has an input field and 'save' buttons.
Appointments can be entered to a specific hour inline, and the 'save' button saves them to local storage.
This application uses jquery and moment.js, and Bootstrap.
